In an era where AI's role is becoming increasingly pivotal across various sectors, Sisyphus aims to streamline the creation of these focused agents, providing a robust framework that simplifies the process of developing, testing, and deploying task-specific AI solutions.

## Why Sisyphus?

In a landscape cluttered with broad-spectrum AI solutions, the need for highly specialized and efficient task-oriented agents is more pronounced than ever. Whether it's for data analysis, automated customer support, content creation, or any other specific task, Sisyphus provides the tools and framework to build AI agents tailored to your unique requirements. By focusing on narrow tasks, Sisyphus-powered agents achieve unparalleled efficiency and accuracy, making them invaluable assets for businesses, researchers, and developers looking to harness the true potential of task-specific AI.

## Installation

Sisyphus is easy to install and can be integrated into your projects with just a few steps. Ensure you have Python installed on your system (Python 3.6 or newer is recommended). You can install Sisyphus using pip, Python's package installer. Simply open your terminal or command prompt and enter the following command:

```bash
pip install sisyphus-ai
```

Wait for the installation to complete, and you're ready to start building your Narrow Task AI Agents with Sisyphus.

## Quick Start

To get started with Sisyphus, follow these simple steps:

1. Import Sisyphus in your Python script:

```python
from sisyphus import TaskAgent
```

2. Create a new instance of a `TaskAgent` and define your task:

```python
my_agent = TaskAgent(task_name="Example Task")
```

3. Train your agent (example code):

```python
my_agent.train(data_source="your_data_source_here")
```

4. Deploy your agent to perform the task:

```python
result = my_agent.perform_task(input_data="your_input_data_here")
print(result)
```

This is just a basic example to get you started. Sisyphus is highly customizable to suit your specific task requirements.

## Examples

Here's a more detailed example of how to use Sisyphus for a common task, such as sentiment analysis:

```python
from sisyphus import SentimentAnalysisAgent

# Initialize the sentiment analysis agent
sentiment_agent = SentimentAnalysisAgent()

# Train the agent with your dataset
sentiment_agent.train(dataset_path="path/to/your/sentiment_dataset.csv")

# Analyze sentiment of a new sentence
sentence = "Sisyphus makes AI development easier and more efficient."
sentiment = sentiment_agent.analyze_sentiment(sentence)
print(f"Sentiment of the sentence: {sentiment}")
```

This example demonstrates the simplicity and power of Sisyphus in handling specific AI tasks. Feel free to adapt and expand upon these examples based on your project's needs.
